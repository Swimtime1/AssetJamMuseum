This Unity project was designed to act as a museum to display game assets created by RPI students for an Asset Jam.
Students were given 24 hours to create a piece of art, a character, and object, a song, sound effects, etc. that could fit the 
theme of Ancient Civilization.
Participants were challenged to work on an asset outside of their comfort zone, and polish it as much as they could.
While the museum itself my made by me, everything displayed in it was created by the credited students below.
